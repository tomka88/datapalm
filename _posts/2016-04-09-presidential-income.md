<h3 class="header">How much should a world leader get paid?</h1>

<p>The topic of world leader salaries seldom make it to the front page of newspapers. Yet there is a story to be told behind the numbers. To this day, I have not come across a formula as to how much the “most important job” in each country ought to be remunerated. Yet, one may expect the salary to be proportional to a country’s development indicator. For instance, a development statistic such as the United Nation’s HDI, or an income inequality indicator as the Gini Index may be good candidates. Whichever indicator is chosen, one may expect world leader salaries to be consistent across countries in relationship to these indicators.</p>

<p>To test this premise, we have gathered data from 53 different countries: GDP per capita alongside the country’s head of state’s annual salary.  For the purposes of this question, let us consider GDP per capita, a widely used (and often misleading) measurement of a country development, as a determining factor of a leader’s annual salary. Not surprisingly, out of the countries sampled, all world leaders have a higher salary than their corresponding country’s GDP per capita.</p>
